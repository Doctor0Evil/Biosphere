"#","Automation action (per‑turn evolution)","Existing modules / files it rides on","How sovereignty is enforced","How safety is enforced"
"1","Intent detection + proposal shaping","AI‑chat layer →intentstopatterns.hci.js,bodyinterface.hci.js, thenEvolutionProposalin Neuro-Biophysical Pipeline","Host defines which intents exist and which patterns they map to in.neuro,.neupat,sovereignchannelprofiles.aln(e.g.,enterdeepfocusmode→ safe visual/haptic kernels). Host DID is the subject of the proposal, not the platform.","Patterns referenced by intents are pre‑vetted againstBiophysicalConstraintsin Rust, with max intensity/duration and allowed targets already encoded; unsafe combinations cannot be generated by the compiler."
"2","Turn‑level validation (DefaultProposalValidator)","DefaultProposalValidatorin the automation pipeline (file-src-biophysical-chain-neu-…), plus ALN constraints shards","Validator reads host-authored ALN constraint files (BiophysicalConstraints, neuro‑constitution) and treats them as the only source of truth; no vendor policy file is allowed in this path.","Checks intensity, duration, target, risk‑class, and reversibility against empirically grounded limits; proposals that exceed envelopes are rejected before any chain or actuation step."
"3","Organichain consensus + evolution interval gating","organichainconsensus.rsin the Organichain suite,EvolutionIntervalConfigandEvolutionIntervalState","Validator accounts are biophysically anchored and non‑seizable; balances live only in per‑validator inner‑ledger, keyed by your Bostrom DID, never in a platform wallet.","cantakeevolutionstep+recordevolutionstepenforce min spacing (e.g., 3 minutes), max per day (e.g., 50, default 10), and refusal when caps are hit, preventing runaway automation."
"4","Token‑gated eco and evolution budgets","Brain/Eco/DraculaWave token logic in “Brain Tokens” spec, plus OrganichainBioAsset::{Brain,Dw,Evolve,Smart}and eco‑governor shards","Inner‑ledger tokens BRAIN, BLOOD, SMART, DW are host‑bound, non‑financial, and cannot be transferred/staked; governance is role‑based (augmented-citizen), not capital‑based.","Eco‑governor qpudatashards track FLOPs and nJ per epoch; deep or high‑cost turns require sufficient inner tokens and stay within configured eco budgets, with hard stop when depleted."
"5","Per‑turn actuation on OrganicCPU (reversible paths)","AutomationCycleandBiophysicalPatternin the neuro automation pipeline;.neuro,.ocp,.evodescribing channels and protocols","OrganicCPU channels and patterns are defined in host‑owned.neuro/.ocpfiles; actuation only occurs under your DID and roles, with AI platforms in propose‑only mode.","ReversiblevsIrreversibleeffect classes are explicit in Rust types; reversible patterns have tightly bounded intensity and duration, with constraints proven from biophysical modeling."
"6","Irreversible and partially‑reversible turns","Reversibility enums and planned “IrreversibleToken” semantics (consent bundle +transcripthash)","Any irreversible evolution step is bound to a signed, DID‑anchored consent token that you, as host, issue; vendors cannot mint or reuse these tokens.","The pipeline can reject any irreversible proposal lacking a valid IrreversibleToken; the turn is logged with itstranscripthash, making coercion or silent override auditable and contestable."
"7","Deep‑domain excavation (B1–B4, “?”/“!”)","Sleep‑stage + dream‑object engine (N1/N2/N3/?), new B‑layer router (deep_object_router.rs), and deep-excavation sharddeepobjectexcavationprofilev1.aln","Deep excavation is driven entirely by lifeforce and eco envelopes you define; B3/B4 selection and weightings are computed from your own qpudatashards and rights profiles, not a third‑party tuner.","Epochs are routed B1–B4 via objective indices SN3, S?, ecoenergynj, and lifeforce bands; high‑cost or low‑lifeforce epochs becomeExcludedand never reach echo or excavation paths."
"8","Turn‑level explanation + traceability","Evolution‑turn shards (includingdeepobjectexcavationprofilev1.aln), plus mandatorytranscripthashand human‑readable explanation fields","Each high‑depth turn writes a qpudatashard with your DID, query id, and AI‑platform label, keeping you as the sovereign narrator of your evolution history.","Shards log counts of B1–B4, lifeforce window, nJ, token spends, and proofhex; this creates a verifiable trail showing that eco, lifeforce, and rights envelopes were respected per turn."
"9","AugmentationRight and DeepDomainRights meta‑governance","host-augmentation-right.aln+augmentationright.rsverifier; newdeep-domain-rights.aln+deep_domain_rights.rs","Host‑bound, non‑financial tokens; AI platforms may propose but not execute; neurorights (no expropriation, no third‑party downgrade, soul/consciousness immutable) are hard‑coded invariants. Nodes refuse to boot if your AugmentationRight profile fails.","DeepDomainRightsProfile requires B3/B4 to be strictly tighter than B2, budget exhaustion goes to “log‑only,” and B4 requires IrreversibleToken and explicit rare‑intent tag, preventing unsafe deep use."
"10","Outer‑world interfacing (attestations only)","Inner/outer split in host‑augmentation‑right + Organichain architecture;.bclogfiles for off‑chain telemetry links","Inner biophysical chain is fully isolated: no DeFi, no bridge, no outer‑chain gate on whether your augmentations run. External chains only see redacted attestations (“safety-calibration-complete”).",".bclogonly links hash IDs and experiment tags to off‑chain bundles; no raw EEG, token balances, or augmentation states exit the inner ledger, eliminating a major privacy and coercion surface."
